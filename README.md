## Projects

### Titanic Survivors EDA

**Notebook:** `Titanic_Survivors.ipynb`

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

**Key Steps:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing distributions, survival rates by class, gender, and other variables.
- **Insights:** Identifying key factors that may have contributed to survival.

### Bank Marketing Dataset EDA

**Notebook:** `Bank_Marketing_Dataset.ipynb`

This project examines a bank marketing dataset to understand the demographics and behaviors of customers in relation to a marketing campaign's success.

**Key Steps:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing customer demographics, campaign success rates, and other relevant factors.
- **Insights:** Analyzing which customer attributes are associated with a successful marketing outcome.

### Breast Cancer EDA

**Notebook:** `Breast Cancer.ipynb`

This project focuses on the exploration of a breast cancer dataset, analyzing the relationships between various features and the diagnosis outcome.

**Key Steps:**
- **Data Preparation:** Normalizing and scaling features for better analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Examining feature distributions, correlations, and their impact on diagnosis.
- **Insights:** Understanding which features are most indicative of a benign or malignant diagnosis.
